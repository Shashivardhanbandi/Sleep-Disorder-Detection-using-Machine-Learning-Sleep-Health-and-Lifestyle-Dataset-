## 🧪 Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
- Random Forest Classifier (RF)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is implemented using:
- **Default Parameters**
- **Tuned Parameters** (for improved accuracy)

   jupyter notebook notebooks/SDD_DT0.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## 📌 Dataset
**Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**  
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, sleep duration, and stress levels.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Explore more models (e.g., XGBoost, SVM)
- Use cross-validation for performance validation
- Add GUI for prediction based on user input
